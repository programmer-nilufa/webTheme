        <h2 class="cl"> What Is Business-to-Business? </h2>
        <strong id="1" class="wr">
        Business-to-business (B2B) is a business model where a business sells or purchases products or services to and from another business.
        
        This type of relationship is common among manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers that will resell the products or services.
        
        Generally, B2B transactions occur in the supply chain, where a specific company will purchase raw materials from another company for manufacturing purposes.
        
        B2B products or services are also more valuable than those at the consumer level.
        
        This is because businesses that engage in B2B transactions are more likely to purchase more of the goods and services than consumers are.
        
        For instance, a bicycle manufacturer will buy a truckload of bicycle tires compared to what a biking enthusiast will buy.
        
        In B2B companies, their marketing campaigns target other businesses instead of consumers, which is B2C.
        
        Clients of B2C companies target individual consumers who are the end-users of the products or services.
        
        In 2022, the global B2B e-commerce market was valued at $7,907.07 billion. It is expected to climb grow by 20.2% from 2023 to 2030.
        
        Internet popularity yields a robust environment in which businesses can easily find out about products and services and lay the groundwork for future business-to-business transactions.</strong><br><br>

            <h2 class="cl">Advantages of B2B</h2>
            <strong id="3" class="wr">In the B2B business model, one business sells a set of products or services to another business.

                There is usually a group or department in that particular company that uses the products and services. It could be a single user on the buyer side making a transaction in support of the business goals of the company.
                
                Some B2B transactions also involve the company using the products, such as computers, merchandise products, furniture, and productivity software.
                
                For more complex or larger service or product purchases, the selection process of B2B product or service is handled by a buying committee, including:
                
                a technical decision-maker or someone who assesses the capabilities of the prospective products or services
                a business decision-maker, such as those responsible for the finances and budgeting
                influencers, such as those individuals who present inputs on the decision.
                Often, large purchases involve a request for proposal, in which the buyer invites possible vendors to submit proposals detailing their products or services, terms, and pricing.</strong>
